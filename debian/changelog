ros-indigo-collada-urdf (1.11.0-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Use VERSION_LESS instead of STRLESS
    The version comparison routines were added in cmake 2.8.0
  * Fix export API detection (for assimp < 2.0.885)
    It looks like this API was added in Assimp 2.0.885:
    https://github.com/assimp/assimp/commit/ae23c03bd9a0b5f1227dc0042fd98f7206c770a8
  * Invert Assimp version detect logic for greater accuracy
  * Updated Assimp defines to be more flexible
    This commit is a follow-up to 85b20197671e142044e471df603debd0faf08baf
    Why was export.h removed from assimp < 3.0.0?
  * Better feature detection for assimp version
    The unified headers were introduced in Assimp 2.0.1150, so checking for Assimp 3.0.0 is not quite the best solution.
    See https://github.com/assimp/assimp/commit/6fa251c2f2e7a142bb861227dce0c26362927fbc
